#  CRUD Application

This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows administrators to manage a product catalog by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting product entries.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new products by entering details such as name, code, price, and quantity.
- **Read**: View a list of all products with their information.
- **Update**: Modify existing product details directly.
- **Delete**: Remove products from the catalog with a single action.

## Product Information

Each product entry includes:
- **Product Name**: The name of the product.
- **Product Code**: A unique identifier for each product.
- **Price**: The cost of the product.
- **Quantity**: The available stock quantity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handles all CRUD operations in the client-side code, storing data locally (e.g., using `localStorage`).

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the interface to add, view, update, or delete products.

## Future Enhancements

- **Data Persistence**: Integrate with a backend or database to store data persistently.
- **User Authentication**: Add a login feature to restrict CRUD operations to authorized users.
- **Improved UI**: Enhance the design and usability of the interface.
